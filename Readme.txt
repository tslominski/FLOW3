FLOW3 1.0.0 SVN
-------------------

Welcome to FLOW3!

There are a few things you need to know to get started with FLOW3. All necessary steps are explained in the FLOW3 Installation Guide which you find on http://flow3.typo3.org/documentation

In short here's what you need to do:

1) Set up a virtual host for your web server and let it point to the Public/ directory of FLOW3.
2) Adjust the file permissions. On Linux / Mac just run "sudo ./setfilepermissions.sh" from FLOW3's main directory
3) Call the URL leading to your virtual host from a browser

Have fun!
