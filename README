You do NOT need to use install.sh if you just want to use the distribution. It
contains everything preconfigured.

== Some hints on unit testing and install.sh ==

install.sh allows to set up the production database as well as databases for
unit testing. It should be self-explanatory.

Additionally there is helper script - mostly used by the unit tests - that
allows some look into the databases, it is at
Packages/TYPO3CR/Tests/Fixtures/testdb.sh

If unit tests for other databases than SQLite are not configured, they will
be skipped.
