You do NOT need to use install.sh if you just want to use the distribution. It
contains everything preconfigured.

If you run into problems, first make sure the permissions are correct, use
fixpermissions.sh to do that!


If you are still sure you want to try install.sh, read on.

== Some hints on unit testing and install.sh ==

install.sh allows to set up the production database as well as databases for
unit testing. It should be self-explanatory.

Before it can be used, you need to remove the echo/exit lines at the top of the
script.

Additionally there is helper script - mostly used by the unit tests - that
allows some look into the databases, it is at
Packages/TYPO3CR/Tests/Fixtures/testdb.sh

If unit tests for other databases than SQLite are not configured, they will
be skipped.
